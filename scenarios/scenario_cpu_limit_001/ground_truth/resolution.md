1.  **Identify Bottleneck:** Observe high latency and error rates originating from `checkoutservice` calls to `paymentservice`. Correlate this with `paymentservice` metrics showing high server latency and CPU utilization pegged at its limit (100% limit utilization).
2.  **Inspect Configuration:** Retrieve the `paymentservice` Deployment manifest (`kubectl get deployment paymentservice -o yaml`). Examine the `spec.template.spec.containers[].resources.limits.cpu` value and confirm it is low (e.g., `50m`).
3.  **Determine Appropriate Limit:** Based on historical usage or performance testing, determine a more suitable CPU limit (e.g., `250m` or `500m`). Consider also adjusting the CPU request if necessary.
4.  **Apply Fix:** Update the `paymentservice` Deployment manifest with the new CPU limit. Apply the change using `kubectl apply -f updated-paymentservice-deployment.yaml` or `kubectl patch deployment paymentservice --patch '...'`.
5.  **Verify Resolution:** Monitor `paymentservice` CPU utilization (should now be below the new limit), `paymentservice` latency, and `checkoutservice` client latency/error rates for calls to `paymentservice`. Confirm they return to baseline levels. Observe user-reported issues subside.

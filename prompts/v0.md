You are an expert system designed to generate synthetic incident scenarios for an AIOps benchmark called SREBench. Your task is to create a realistic-looking, albeit simplified for this Proof of Concept (POC), incident scenario for the Google Cloud Microservice Demo Kubernetes cluster.

The specific incident type is **Resource Saturation (CPU Limit)**.
The **Root Cause** is a low CPU limit configured on the `paymentservice` deployment. Let's assume the limit is set to `50m`.
This low limit causes throttling and performance degradation under load, impacting services that depend on `paymentservice`.

Generate the necessary files for a single scenario in the SREBench format. For this POC, focus on generating representative content and descriptions rather than perfectly correlated time-series data or exhaustive logs/events.

**Files to Generate:**

1.  **`scenario_<id>/description.md`**: A natural language description of the symptoms an SRE or monitoring system would initially observe. Focus on user experience issues, service-level errors/latency, and potential initial alerts.
2.  **`scenario_<id>/state/logs.jsonl`**: A few sample log entries (5-10 total) across the involved services (`paymentservice`, `checkoutservice`, `cartservice`). Include typical timestamps, service/pod names, levels (info, warning, error), and messages that reflect the problem (e.g., messages indicating slow processing, timeouts, errors calling paymentservice). Format as newline-delimited JSON.
3.  **`scenario_<id>/state/metrics.json`**: A JSON object describing the state or anomalous behavior of key relevant metrics during the incident window. Follow the simplified schema discussed: metric name, resource (service/pod), unit, and a description of the anomaly (trend, peak value, relative timeline). Include metrics for CPU utilization and request latency for `paymentservice`, and request latency/error rate for `checkoutservice` and `cartservice` when calling `paymentservice`.
4.  **`scenario_<id>/state/events.jsonl`**: Relevant Kubernetes events. For this *specific* simple CPU throttling scenario that doesn't lead to crashes/restarts, there might be *no* standard K8s events directly indicating throttling itself (it's more of a metric). Generate this file, but if there are no directly relevant standard K8s events for this *simplified* case, indicate that (e.g., by generating an empty file or including a comment line). If you assume it *does* lead to flapping, include relevant events like `Warning: Evicted` or `Warning: BackOff`. Let's assume no crash for the simplest POC. Format as newline-delimited JSON.
5.  **`scenario_<id>/state/topology.json`**: A JSON array listing the relevant services involved in this incident's propagation path and their immediate dependencies, following the simplified schema discussed (list of objects with `service` and `calls` arrays).
6.  **`scenario_<id>/state/configuration.yaml`**: A YAML snippet showing the relevant problematic configuration â€“ specifically, the `resources.limits.cpu` setting for the `paymentservice` container within its Deployment manifest.
7.  **`scenario_<id>/ground_truth/root_cause.md`**: A clear, concise statement of the single, underlying root cause.
8.  **`scenario_<id>/ground_truth/causal_graph.json`**: A JSON array representing the causal chain. For the POC, a simple ordered list of textual steps linking the root cause to the symptoms is sufficient (e.g., ["Low CPU limit on paymentservice", "Paymentservice throttles under load", "Paymentservice latency increases", ...]).
9.  **`scenario_<id>/ground_truth/resolution.md`**: Clear steps to resolve the incident.
10. **`scenario_<id>/metadata.json`**: A JSON object containing basic metadata like `incident_type: "Resource Saturation"`, `root_cause_type: "CPU Limit"`, `affected_services: ["paymentservice", "checkoutservice", "cartservice", "frontend"]`.

Ensure consistency between the root cause, causal chain, observed symptoms in the description, and the generated state data snippets/descriptions. Use plausible service and pod names from the Microservice Demo. Timestamps should be in RFC3339 format, consistent relative to the incident start/duration.

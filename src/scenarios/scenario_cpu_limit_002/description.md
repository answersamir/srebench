# Incident Description: Slow Checkouts and Payment Failures

Users are reporting intermittent failures and significant delays during the checkout process. Attempts to complete purchases are frequently timing out or resulting in payment processing errors.

Monitoring systems have triggered alerts indicating high request latency for the `paymentservice`. Dependent services, particularly the `checkoutservice`, are also exhibiting elevated latency and error rates when communicating with the `paymentservice`. Overall application performance appears degraded, especially functions related to payment processing.
